    Create first web page
    Modify index.html by adding link to first web page
    Rename pages/media to recipes-rest/images
    
    The first web page representing first recipe is added initally only
    including title of dish as heading.
    Then in order to make it acessable as one of the website recipes
    home page is modified to include link element enabeling acess to it
    as part of website.
    Finally pages/media is renimed to recipes-rest/images due to latter
    being more descriptive of actual content present in directory
    due to it for now only contaning images

    Edit README.md
    
    The README.md file contained HTML which on GitHub resulted in HTML elements being included
    as part of README.md file resulting in unwanted formating.To avoid this the ```html snippets were used
    in order to avoid interpretation of text as HTML.Now HTML is interpreted as text as originally intended.

    Adds index.html as well as recipes-html and pages
    Due to each recipe being separate as unit from any other on web page
    level it is then necessary to have a web page providing access to all
    of web pages within website to user and have it served first to user
    upon website visit which is implemented via index.html. And web pages
    themselves are defined and organized in recipes-html directory containing
    all html files and pages directory containing all related data to web pages
    both directories containing components defining web pages
