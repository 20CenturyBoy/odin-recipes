        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This is a great recipe when you don't want to wait for the dough to rise. 
            You just mix it and allow it to rest for 5 minutes and then it's ready to go! 
            It yields a soft, chewy crust.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Yeast</li>
            <li>Bread Flour</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>

                <h3>Let the Dough Come to Room Temperature</h3>
                <p>
                    After you're finished mixing the ingredients, allow your dough to rest on the counter for about 30 minutes.
                     This will allow the gluten to relax, making the dough much easier to stretch and shape. 
                     Cold dough is much more difficult to work with.

                <h3>Prepare Your Surface With Oil</h3>
                <p>
                    You might feel inclined to prep your workspace with a big handful of flour to prevent sticking. This is a helpful step with many kinds of dough. 
                    However, in this case, too much flour can make your pizza crust tough. Instead, rub your surface (and your hands) with a few tablespoons of olive oil and maybe a little bit of flour. 
                    This will prevent sticking, encourage a crispy texture, and ensure a gorgeous golden color.
