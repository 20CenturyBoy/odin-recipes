                    Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Add carrot, celery, and onion. Cook until crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Add ginger and garlic. Cook 1 minute more. Add broth, soy sauce, basil, oregano, and pepper. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, until carrots are just tender about 5 minutes.
